Decommissioning the Detector:

The primary goal of decommissioning is to tag SiPMs that might have broken during
the warming-up period, and to identify ArCLight panels which may have sustained damage.

The latter portion of that mission is difficult: cracks in the ArCLight panels could be 
of any size, of any length, and in any direction. We know we run the risk of cracking, but
we have yet to study it in action.
