Channel Mapping: 

The 2x2 LRS consists of a multi-stage readout chain, both for data acquisition and triggering. 
At each stage, there are opportunities for cabling or software errors which can impact 
what operating bias is applied to which SiPM channel, or which SiPMs recieve which self-triggering threshold. 

In order to correctly apply bespoke settings to individual and sum channels, care should be taken during
the commissioning stages to characterize hardware and software channel mappings. 

This directory contains scripts used during Run 2 to achieve that end.
