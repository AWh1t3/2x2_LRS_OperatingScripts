SiPM Operation Commissioning:

I'm defining commissioning tasks related to SiPM operation as:

1. Breakdown voltage characterization
2. Operating voltage optimization
3. Gain characterization 
4. Self-trigger threshold setting and testing

Scripts pertaining to these studies will be saved in this directory with descriptions of the
methodologies used in Run 2 to aquire the relevant data.
