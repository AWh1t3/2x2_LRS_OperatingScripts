Low-Level Commissioning:

I'm definining "low-level" commissioning as:

1. Dead Channel scans
2. Baseline characterization (per channnel)
3. Environmental noise studies

Scripts used during the 2x2 Run 2 for these purposes will be saved in this directory, and the
procedures governing their use/the acquisition of related data will be described.
